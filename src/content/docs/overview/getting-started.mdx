Welcome to GpgFrontend, the cross-platform, [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)
encryption tool designed for simplicity and security. This guide will walk you
through the installation process tailored to your operating system, ensuring you
can start securing your communications as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Before You Begin: Prerequisites

GpgFrontend leverages the robust functionalities of
[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) for encryption, decryption, and key management.
It is crucial to have GnuPG installed on your device to make full use of
GpgFrontend.

**Windows users:**  
GnuPG is bundled with GpgFrontend for Windows. You do not need to install it separately.

**macOS users:**  
Install GnuPG before running GpgFrontend.

- Recommended: `brew install gnupg` (using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg))
- Alternatively: Download GPG for OSX from [GPG for OSX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpgosx/files).

**Linux users:**  
Most modern distributions include GnuPG by default. To check your version, run `gpg --version`

If you need to install or upgrade:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gpg`
- Fedora: `sudo yum install gnupg`

**BSD users:**  
GnuPG must be installed manually. Refer to your system's package manager or build from source.

<Aside type="caution">
  Starting from GpgFrontend version 2.1.8, GnuPG **2.4 or later** is required
  for all features to function correctly. GnuPG 2.2 is the minimum supported
  version for basic functionality, but some advanced features may be
  unavailable.
