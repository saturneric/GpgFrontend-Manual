## Open Source, Always

As a community-driven, open-source project, GpgFrontend is entirely free and
transparent, welcoming contributions, feedback, and ideas from users worldwide.

## Your Privacy First

GpgFrontend is built with privacy as its top priority. It's designed for true
offline security. No telemetry, no cloud syncing, and no outside dependencies.
All encryption, decryption, and signing are performed **locally** on your
device, so your secrets never leave your machine.

Whether you're online or offline, your data remains 100% under your control.  
Join us in making encryption simple, robust, and truly private. That's because
your privacy is non-negotiable.

## Mission and Origins

GpgFrontend draws its inspiration and core philosophy from the stable, portable,
and cross-platform **[gpg4usb](https://git.bktus.com/gpgfrontend/gpg4usb/)**
project. Inheriting the spirit of true portability and platform independence,
GpgFrontend builds on this foundation to deliver advanced features, modern
cryptographic standards, and a clean, intuitive user experience.

As described in the article _["The Past and Present of GpgFrontend: My Journey
with an Open-Source Encryption
Tool"](https://blog.bktus.com/en/archives/u8hywl/)_, the project began with a
simple question:

> "What if everyone could have a small, reliable, and secure 'crypto machine'. A
> tool that makes encryption as tangible and trustworthy as turning a key in a
> lock?"

That idea became the cornerstone of GpgFrontend's mission: **to make OpenPGP
encryption truly accessible by making it simple, robust, and convenient for
everyone, on any major operating system.**
