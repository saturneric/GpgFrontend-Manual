nearly every piece of user feedback—whether about interface design, new
features, or compatibility—has been addressed in the very next release. Your

just for you.

## Your Privacy First

GpgFrontend is built with privacy as its top priority—designed for true offline
security. No telemetry, no cloud syncing, and no outside dependencies. All
encryption, decryption, and signing are performed **locally** on your device, so
your secrets never leave your machine.

Join us in making encryption simple, robust, and truly private—because your
privacy is non-negotiable.

## Mission and Origins

GpgFrontend draws its inspiration and core philosophy from the stable, portable,
and cross-platform [gpg4usb](https://www.gpg4usb.org/) project. Inheriting the
spirit of true portability and platform independence, GpgFrontend builds on this
foundation to deliver even more advanced features, modern algorithm support, and
an intuitive user experience. Its mission is to make powerful OpenPGP encryption
truly accessible—simple, robust, and convenient for everyone, on any major
operating system.
