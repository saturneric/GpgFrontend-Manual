**GpgFrontend** is not just another [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)
tool—it’s your fast, portable, and truly independent encryption companion.
Whether you’re just starting out or already a privacy expert, GpgFrontend
empowers you with secure communication—no clutter, no bloat, total control.

## Why GpgFrontend?

GpgFrontend is more than a simple “button-and-command” wrapper around GnuPG.
Every detail is designed for real-world usability, security, and portability:

- **Effortless Encryption & Signing:** Quickly encrypt, decrypt, and sign texts,
  files, and emails in one click.
- **Multiple Independent Key Databases:** Manage different keys and identities
  for various projects or teams—keep everything organized and secure.
- **Truly Portable:** Run GpgFrontend from a USB drive and carry your keys and
  settings easily between devices.
- **Advanced Yet Accessible:** Supports modern algorithms (RSA, EdDSA, ECDSA,
  ECDH, etc.), advanced features like KeyPackage, public key sync,
  backup/restore, and powerful security options—all while remaining easy for
  beginners.
- **Error Prevention:** Built-in checks, clear workflows, and guidance help you
  avoid accidental mistakes.
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** No browser engines, no heavy frameworks. Minimal
  memory usage, instant startup, and zero background bloat.
- **Consistent Experience Everywhere:** Native support for Windows, macOS,
  Linux, and buildable on FreeBSD—always the same look and feel.

just for you.

## Your Privacy First

GpgFrontend is built with privacy as its top priority—designed for true offline
security. No telemetry, no cloud syncing, and no outside dependencies. All
encryption, decryption, and signing are performed **locally** on your device, so
your secrets never leave your machine.

Whether you’re online or offline, your data remains 100% under your control.  
Join us in making encryption simple, robust, and truly private—because your
privacy is non-negotiable.

## Mission and Origins

GpgFrontend draws its inspiration and core philosophy from the stable, portable,
and cross-platform [gpg4usb](https://www.gpg4usb.org/) project. Inheriting the
spirit of true portability and platform independence, GpgFrontend builds on this
foundation to deliver even more advanced features, modern algorithm support, and
an intuitive user experience. Our mission is to make powerful OpenPGP encryption
truly accessible—simple, robust, and convenient for everyone, on any major
operating system.
