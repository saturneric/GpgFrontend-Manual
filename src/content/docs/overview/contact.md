### About My Domain

The domain `BKTUS.com` (“Bakantu union us”) is just a personal domain I
registered as a teenager. “Bakantu” is simply a made-up word—no hidden meaning!
I just wanted a name that blended technology and community, reflecting values
like innovation, connectivity, and collaboration. :)

### Language Proficiency

I can use the following languages and welcome communication in any of them:

- English
- Chinese
- German

### Secure Communication (GPG Public Key)

For secure and encrypted communication, below is my long-term PGP public key.
