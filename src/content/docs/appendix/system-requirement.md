title: System Requirement
---

Before installing GpgFrontend, please verify that your system meets the
following specifications to ensure optimal performance and feature support.

## Hardware

For smooth operation, we recommend:

- RAM: 2 GB or more (minimum 1 GB)
- Disk: 200 MB free for installation (plus extra for files)
- CPU: Dual-core or better

These are guidelines. GpgFrontend may run on lower-spec machines, but
performance can suffer with large files or keyrings.

## OS

- Windows 10 / 11
- macOS 13 or later
- Ubuntu 22.04 or later

> Note: Only 64-bit systems are supported. 32-bit systems are not supported.

## GnuPG

- Minimum 2.2.0
- Recommended 2.4.0+ for full feature support

> On Windows: GnuPG is bundled with the Application, so no separate installation
> needed.

## Network

Although not necessary for basic operation, an active Internet connection may be
required for software updates and accessing online help resources.

Please note that these are the minimal requirements that we tested, and actual
requirements for your use case could be higher, especially for large datasets.
