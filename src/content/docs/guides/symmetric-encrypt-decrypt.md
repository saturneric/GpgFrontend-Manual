## 🔐 What Is Symmetric Encryption?

**Symmetric encryption** is a method of securing data where the **same
password** is used to both encrypt and decrypt information.

Unlike **asymmetric encryption**, which uses a public/private key pair,
symmetric encryption relies on a single shared secret (the password). This
approach is:

- ✅ Fast and efficient
- ✅ Ideal for large files or quick one-time sharing
- ❗ Best used when both parties can safely share the password

> 📌 If someone intercepts the password, the encrypted data is no longer secure
> — so always handle password exchange carefully.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. You choose a **strong password**.
2. That password is used to **encrypt** the data.
3. Anyone with the **same password** can **decrypt** it.
4. No key pair is required — only the shared password.

> 📎 Encryption security depends entirely on the strength and secrecy of the
> password used.

## ✍️ Encrypting Data Symmetrically

To encrypt text using symmetric encryption:

1. **Enter the Text**
   - Input the plaintext (the content you want to protect).

2. **Start Encryption**
   - Choose to encrypt **without selecting any public key**.

3. **Set a Password**
   - When prompted, enter a **strong, unique password**.
   - This becomes your **encryption key**.

4. **Encryption Completes**
   - The text is transformed into ciphertext.
   - You can now save it or share it with someone.

> 🔐 The recipient will need the **exact same password** to decrypt the message.

## 🔓 Decrypting Symmetric Encrypted Data

To decrypt content that was encrypted symmetrically:

1. **Paste the Ciphertext**
   - The message should begin with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----` and end with
     `-----END PGP MESSAGE-----`.

2. **Initiate Decryption**
   - Choose to decrypt the message.

3. **Enter the Password**
   - Input the **same password** that was used for encryption.

4. **View the Plaintext**
   - If the password is correct, the original message will be revealed.

> 🧠 If the password is incorrect or mistyped, decryption will fail.

## 💡 When to Use Symmetric Encryption?

Symmetric encryption is a great choice when:

- You’re encrypting something **for yourself** (e.g. storing private notes or
  backup files).
- You’re sharing data over a **secure channel**, and can **safely provide the
  password**.
- You don’t want to manage public/private key infrastructure.

However, it is **not ideal** for public communication where secure password
exchange is difficult.

## 🛡️ Tips for Better Security

- Always use a **strong, complex password** (longer is better).
- Never send passwords through insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted email).
- Consider using symmetric encryption as a supplement to public-key encryption —
  e.g., encrypt a file symmetrically, then encrypt the password with the
  recipient’s public key.

| Feature                | Symmetric Encryption                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Key type               | Single shared password                      |
| Use case               | Fast, simple encryption                     |
| Ideal for              | Self-encryption or trusted 1-to-1 sharing   |
| Sensitive to           | Password leaks                              |
| Key management needed  | ❌ No                                        |

Symmetric encryption is a lightweight and powerful tool — when used correctly.
Always combine it with safe password management to ensure your data stays truly
secure.
