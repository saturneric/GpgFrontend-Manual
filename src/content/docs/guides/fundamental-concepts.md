If you're new to **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** or **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**,
this guide is for you. GPG is a free, open-source system for **encrypting
information** and **verifying identity**. It's widely used for secure
communication, file protection, and digital signing.

Let’s walk through the core concepts in a beginner-friendly way.

## 🔐 What Is a Key Pair?

At the heart of GPG is the **key pair**: two mathematically linked keys.

- **Public Key**: Share this with anyone. Others use it to:
  - Send you encrypted messages.
  - Verify your digital signature.
- **Private Key**: Keep this secret. You use it to:
  - Decrypt messages sent to you.
  - Sign data so others know it’s really from you.

:::tip[Think of it like a mailbox]

- Your public key is the address — people can send you letters.
- Your private key is the key to open the mailbox — only you can read what’s
  inside.

## 🔧 Generating a Key Pair

To use GPG, you first create a key pair. During creation, you’ll choose:

- A **cryptographic algorithm** (e.g., RSA, ECC).
- A **key size** (larger sizes are more secure but slower).
- A **passphrase** to protect the private key.

:::caution
🔒 Your passphrase adds a layer of protection — even if someone gets your key
file, they can’t use it without this password.

## 🧩 What Are Subkeys?

A GPG identity doesn’t stop at one key pair. You can create **subkeys** under
your primary key. These are used for specific tasks:

- **Encryption Subkey**: Used to encrypt/decrypt data.
- **Signing Subkey**: Used to create/verifiy digital signatures.

Subkeys are tied to your identity, but they can be revoked or replaced
independently.

> ✅ Tip: Use subkeys for everyday tasks and keep your **primary key offline** or
> backed up securely.

## 🧱 Understanding the Primary Key

Your **primary key** is your core identity. It:

- Links to your user ID (usually name + email).
- Signs your subkeys.
- Can certify other people's public keys (used to build trust networks).

:::caution

If someone gains access to your **primary private key**, they can impersonate
you. That’s why:

- It should be **backed up** securely.
- It’s best to use **subkeys** for daily operations.
- Some people even keep their primary key **offline** for maximum safety.

## ✉️ How Encryption Works

Imagine you want to send a private message to someone:

1. You encrypt the message using their **public key**.
2. Only their **private key** can decrypt it.
3. You can also add your **signature** using your private key.
4. They can **verify your signature** with your public key.

This ensures:

- **Privacy**: No one but the intended recipient can read the message.
- **Authenticity**: The recipient knows the message is from you.

## 🖋️ What Is Digital Signing?

Signing is like sealing a document with your unique fingerprint. It allows
others to:

- Confirm the message hasn’t been changed.
- Confirm that **you** are the sender.

Digital signatures are used to:

- Sign emails.
- Sign files or software packages.
- Sign other people's public keys (to build trust).

## 📦 Real-Life Use Cases

### Secure Email

You want to email a sensitive document:

- Encrypt it using the recipient’s public key.
- Sign it with your private key.
- The recipient decrypts and verifies it.

### Software Publishing

You release a file or program online:

- You sign it.
- Users can verify the signature before using it.

### Building Trust

You meet someone at a conference:

- You exchange and sign each other’s keys.
- Anyone who trusts your key may now also trust theirs.

## 🏷️ Public Key Certificates

A public key in GPG/PGP is not just a raw cryptographic key. It is always
packaged as a certificate, which contains more than just the key itself.

A public key certificate includes:

- The public key data (for encryption and verifying signatures)
- The User ID (your name and email address)
- Signatures made by your own primary key and, optionally, by other people

### Why Are Certificates Important?

- Binding Identity: The certificate links your key to your identity, such as
  your name and email. This way, people can verify that the key truly belongs to
  you.
- Establishing Trust: Others can “sign” your public key, vouching for your
  identity. This signature acts as a recommendation, forming a “Web of Trust.”
- Subkey Relationship: If you use subkeys (for encryption or signing), their
  certificates include signatures from your primary key. This proves that each
  subkey really belongs to your primary identity, and not to someone else.

### Example

When you share your public key, you are actually sharing a certificate that:

- Includes your identity and any subkeys
- Shows cryptographic proof that the subkeys are authorized by your primary key
- May be signed by other people who trust your identity

This is why you should always distribute your full public key certificate—not
just the bare key!

## ✅ Best Practices for New Users

1. **Back Up Your Keys**: Store your private key and revocation certificate in a
   secure, offline location.
2. **Use Strong Passphrases**: The private key is only as safe as the password
   protecting it.
3. **Separate Daily and Master Keys**: Use subkeys for regular work; keep your
   primary key protected.
4. **Update When Needed**: Cryptography evolves — review and rotate keys as
   needed.
5. **Revoke If Compromised**: If your private key is stolen or lost, revoke it
   immediately and inform your contacts.
6. **Understand the Web of Trust**: GPG builds trust by people signing each
   other's keys — this forms a decentralized trust model.

## 🧰 Where Does GpgFrontend Fit In?

While GPG/PGP itself is powerful, it is mostly command-line based — which can be
intimidating for beginners.

This is where **GpgFrontend** comes in.

GpgFrontend is a graphical interface built on top of GnuPG. It helps users
perform key operations such as:

- Generating and managing key pairs
- Encrypting and decrypting messages or files
- Signing and verifying content
- Uploading and fetching keys from key servers
- More...

All of this can be done through a **clear and user-friendly interface**, making
GPG accessible without needing to learn complex commands.

Whether you're just starting to explore encrypted communication or already
managing multiple keys, GpgFrontend acts as a bridge — combining the strength of
GPG with simplicity and clarity.

You focus on **secure communication** — let GpgFrontend handle the complexity
behind it.
