GpgFrontend introduces **Multi-Key Database Support**, providing users with a
flexible and organized way to manage multiple key databases. This feature is
ideal for users who require separate cryptographic environments for different
projects, organizations, or levels of security.

## Features

- **Multiple Key Databases**: Manage distinct key databases for specific
  purposes or contexts.
- **Flexible Switching**: Easily switch between databases for different
  operations without affecting other configurations.
- **Customizable Management**: Add, edit, reorder, or remove databases as
  needed.

## Benefits

- **Improved Security**: Isolate sensitive keys in dedicated databases to
  minimize exposure.
- **Enhanced Organization**: Maintain separate databases for better operational
  clarity.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Quickly switch between databases for various
  projects or encryption tasks.

## Accessing the Multi-Key Database Feature

To manage multiple key databases, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Click on the **Advanced** menu in the top navigation bar.

2. Select **Open GnuPG Controller** from the dropdown options.

3. In the **GnuPG Controller** window, switch to the **Key Database** tab.

4. Here, you will find a list of all configured key databases.

</Steps>

## Managing Key Databases

The Key Database tab allows you to perform the following operations:

### Adding a New Key Database

- Click the Add New Key Database button.
- Specify a name and path for the new database. This will create an isolated
  environment for newly generated or imported keys.

**Relative Path Support:** If you enable the Relative Path option, the specified
absolute path will be automatically converted to a path relative to the
GpgFrontend application directory. This is particularly useful for Portable Mode
or when moving the application between different systems, as it ensures that key
database paths remain valid and consistent regardless of the host environment.

### Editing and Reordering Key Databases

Right-click on a database entry to view options like:

- **Move Up/Move Down**: Reorder the database list.
- **Move to Top**: Prioritize a database by moving it to the top. If a database
  is at the top, it is considered as the Default Key Database.
- **Edit**: Rename or modify the path of an existing database.
- **Remove**: Delete a database from the configuration.

:::caution

Any changes to the key database settings will require an application
restart to take effect.

### Switching Between Databases

- Use the **Key Toolbox** dropdown in the main interface to switch between
  configured databases.
- Select the desired database, and the corresponding keys will be displayed.

## Use Cases for Multi-Key Databases

- Project Isolation: Maintain separate databases for different projects to
  avoid accidental cross-use of keys.
- Organizational Separation: Keep departmental or team-specific keys isolated
  to ensure they are only accessible to authorized personnel.
- Enhanced Security for Sensitive Keys: Store high-security keys in a dedicated
  database, minimizing the risk of exposure during routine operations.

## Tips for Effective Multi-Key Database Usage

- Name Databases Clearly: Use descriptive names for each database to make it
  easier to identify their purpose.
- Regular Backups: Backup each database regularly to prevent loss of critical
  keys. Store backups in secure, encrypted locations.
- Audit Database Usage: Periodically review the contents and usage of each
  database to ensure proper organization and security.
- Isolate Sensitive Operations: For highly sensitive keys, consider using a
  dedicated device or environment to manage their database.
- Avoid Overloading Databases: Distribute keys evenly across multiple databases
  instead of overloading a single one. This enhances performance and
  organization.
