Keeping your public keys in sync with those stored on a key server is crucial
for secure communications. This synchronization ensures that any changes to
public keys, such as revocations or the addition of subkeys, are reflected in
your local keyring. Without this, you may be vulnerable to security risks like
man-in-the-middle attacks or authentication errors.

Here's a structured guide to maintaining public key synchronization using the
GpgFrontend's Public Key Sync feature.

## Importance of Public Key Synchronization

**Key Revocation:** If a key is revoked by its owner, it's vital to stop using
it immediately. Revocation might occur if the private key is compromised or if
the key is no longer used.

**Subkey Updates:** If a new signing subkey is generated, it's essential for
your local gpg to recognize it. Without the updated information, gpg won't
authenticate signatures made with the new subkey.

## How to Sync Public Keys

GpgFrontend automates the public key synchronization process through a
user-friendly interface. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. Open the **Key Management** interface.
2. In the list of public keys, you can now select specific keys to sync by
   checking the boxes next to them.
3. Locate and click the **Sync Public Key** button. This initiates the automatic
   synchronization for the selected keys. If no keys are selected, all public
   keys will be synchronized. In this case, a confirmation prompt will appear to
   confirm full synchronization.

The feature works by checking all the public keys in your possession against the
key server. If there's an updated version of a key you own, GpgFrontend will
import the new details to your local keyring.

### Choosing the Right Key Server

To know which key server GpgFrontend interacts with, follow these steps:

1. Go to the settings section of GpgFrontend.
2. The default key server configured will be listed here.

_Note: Replace the placeholder text with the actual link to the image showing
the key server settings._

If you need to use a different key server:

1. Navigate to the key server settings within GpgFrontend.
2. Add your preferred key server's details.
3. Set it as the default for future synchronizations.

## Best Practices for Key Synchronization

- **Regular Sync:** Regularly sync your keys to ensure you have the latest
  updates, especially before engaging in secure communication.
- **Verify Changes:** After syncing, verify any changes or updates to ensure
  they are legitimate.
- **Secure Network:** Always perform key synchronization over a secure network
  to prevent interception or tampering.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can ensure that your public keys are always
up-to-date, reflecting the current status on the key server, thereby maintaining
the integrity of your encrypted communications.
